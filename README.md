# Codename: KV2
<sub>The name will change when I think of a better one.</sub>

This project is a web application to help track your roster in a wargaming campaign.

## Status - pre-Alpha
As of 2022-05-30, I'm developing directly against the `main` branch.
Major features have yet to be implemented.
There is no 'production' deployment.

## Documentation
Design documents can be found [in the docs folder](https://github.com/edward3h/kv2/tree/main/docs).

## Getting Started
### Requirements
* Java - JDK 17 or later. [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) is the recommended tool for managing JDK version.
* [GNG](https://github.com/gdubw/gng) is _recommended_ to use the `gw` command instead of `./gradlew`
* node.js version as in `client.nvmrc`. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is the recommended tool for managing Node version.
